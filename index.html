        <h2>About the Persona Series</h2>

        <p>This website focuses on the Persona video game series developed by Atlus, 
            a role-playing franchise that blends an everyday life simulation with 
            supernatural elements. The site explores how the 
            series uses themes of identity, self-discovery, and societal pressure, 
            along with mythological symbolism, to create its narratives.</p>
